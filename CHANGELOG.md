## 5.0.0 2024/09/11
- Made sure the global download lock blocks and ensures min_update_time. (@agroszer)
- Add UI configuration support
- Fixed #89
- Fixed #126
- Fixed #140
- Fixed #144

### IMPORTANT
Do **NOT** update to this version from version 3.2.0 or older! Update to versoin 4.0.0 and follow the instructions at [UpgradeTo4.0AndLater.md](https://github.com/franc6/ics_calendar/blob/releases/UpgradeTo4 **first**!

UI configuration is now supported, and configuration via YAML is now deprecated. After installing this update, and after restarting Home Assistant, please remove your existing YAML configuration for ICS calendar. **Your existing configuration has been imported!** Failure to remove the entries doesn't hurt anything, but will cause additional log entries about it.

In a future release, YAML configuration support will be removed entirely, so please be sure to update before that happens, or you will lose your existing configuration.

## 4.2.0 2024/01/15
- Add timeout feature.  Thanks to @iamjackg!
- Fixed #117

## 4.1.0 2023/11/07
- Add feature for #107

## 4.0.1 2023/10/24
- Attempt to give an error message for missing configuration

## 4.0.0 2023/10/17
- Change to be a component, since HA doesn't seem likely to allow UI configuration of the calendar component. :(
### Breaking Change
You must update your YAML configuration with this update.  This integration is no longer a platform for the calendar component.  Instead, it's a component on its own that provides calendars.  Please see [UpgradeTo4.0AndLater.md](https://github.com/franc6/ics_calendar/blob/releases/UpgradeTo4.0AndLater.md) for more information on upgrading.  Please read that carefully before upgrading to this version!

## 3.2.0 2023/09/19
- Added new option, accept_header to allow setting an Accept header for misconfigured servers.
- Updated dependencies

## 3.1.8 2023/08/23
- Fixed #90
- Fixed #92

### Breaking Change
- Updated to require HA 2023.6.  This release requires python 3.11, which is also required by HA 2023.6 and later, so that's the new minimum.

## 3.1.7 2023/02/07
- Fixed #76/#85
- Fixed #77; you can now use {year} and {month} in your URLs to get the current 4 digit year and 2 digit month.
- Fixed #78; you can now specify an offset in hours if your calendar entries have the wrong time zone.

## 3.1.6 2022/12/12
- Handle UTF-8 BOM in calendar data.
- Properly decode UTF-16 calendar data.

## 3.1.5 2022/11/01
- Handle gzip-encoded responses for servers that incorrectly return gzip'd data.  Thanks to @omnigrok for finding the problem and suggesting a fix!

## 3.1.4 2022/10/17
- Fixed a problem with using authentication with multiple calendars.  Thanks to @Romkabouter for finding the problem and suggesting a fix!

## 3.1.3 2022/10/04
- Refactored code for comparing events when getting current event.  This is now consistent between parsers.  Please report problems if short-duration events don't trigger your automations!
- Fixed #64
- Updated dependencies

## 3.1.2 2022/08/16
- Fixed filter bug for events without a description (thanks to jberrenberg for @identifying and fixing it)
- Please note ICS Calendar is now in the default store for HACS!  You don't need to do anything.

## 3.1.1 2022/08/02
### This release is to correct 3.1.0, which should have required HA 2022.7!
- Added new exclude/include filters (See README.md)
- Added new user_agent option
### Breaking Changes!
- As previously noted, "includeAllDay" was deprecated with v2.9.0.  This version removes support for it. Please use "include_all_day" instead!
- Python 3.10 is now required!
- HA 2022.7 is now required!

## 3.1.0 2022/07/22
- Added new exclude/include filters (See README.md)
- Added new user_agent option
### Breaking Changes!
- As previously noted, "includeAllDay" was deprecated with v2.9.0.  This version removes support for it. Please use "include_all_day" instead!
- Python 3.10 is now required!
- HA 2022.7 is now required!

## 3.0.3 2022/07/19
- Fixed #57
- Updated ics dependency to 0.7.2
- Updated icalendar dependency to 4.1.0

## 3.0.2 2022/06/30
- Updated dependencies

## 3.0.1 2022/06/28
- Fixed #54 which I believe was introduced by PR 71887 of home-assisstant/core. This fix reduces some of the aggressive caching, since the HA calendar code now behaves differently. Given the changes, caching the result of async_get_events is undesirable.
- This may also fix #56
- Applied fix from PR 72922 for home-assistant/core to reduce memory copies

## 3.0.0 2022/05/09
- Refactored to use new CalendarEvent and CalendarEntity classes from HA

## 2.9.0 2022/04/19
- Significant refactoring to change how data is cached and when; should resolve #38
- Added new option, download_interval to set the time between downloading the calendar.  Set to a multiple of 15.
- Renamed includeAllDay to be include_all_day to better match other options.
  The old name will continue to work until version 3.1.0.
- This release includes some aggressive data caching, and will consume more memory. However, CPU usage should be signficantly reduced, especially if download_interval is set to a value of 60 or more. A future release will attempt to reduce the memory usage.
